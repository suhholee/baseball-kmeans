# baseball-kmeans

For this project I have performed K-means clustering on baseball batters' data to create a model that can easily group them into different types according to their characteristics shown from different data (e.g. AVG, RBI, OPS, etc.). This model can be applied and used to scout and analyze players more easily by using dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques.
